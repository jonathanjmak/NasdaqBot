# NasdaqBot


We created a Facebook Messenger Bot to help ease new investors and traders into the practice through stock predictions and data visualization. Utilized Wit for NLP with plans of future deployments on Luis instead. After migration to Azure, could be deployed to multiple online platforms rather than just Facebook. Hosted on heroku and written in node.js.

created for HackMIT 2017 as part of the competition using NASDAQ's API.
